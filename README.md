# Abstract
Since the 1990s, there has been a notable surge in initiatives aimed at addressing gender inequalities in the labour market. This project critically examines the impact of these reforms on the economic growth of the United Kingdom. The primary focus of the research is to discern the effects of female employment on the country's real GDP. Through rigorous statistical analysis, we observe a discernible negative correlation between female employment rates and real GDP. Moreover, our regression analysis highlights the presence of regional dependencies influencing national economic growth in the UK.

Surprisingly, London stands out with the highest percentage increase in employed females compared to other regions. However, an unexpected outcome surfaces as London exhibits the most significant negative association between female employment and real GDP. This paradoxical finding underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between gender employment dynamics and economic growth.

The implications for economic growth are evident in the suboptimal levels of female participation, suggesting that regional-level reforms could potentially catalyse positive contributions to the national economy. This study emphasizes the importance of considering regional nuances in the ongoing efforts to address gender inequalities and encourages policymakers to tailor interventions that resonate with the unique economic landscapes of specific regions within the United Kingdom.
